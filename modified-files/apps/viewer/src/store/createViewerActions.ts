    // `set` above puts `pendingColorUpdates: null` (`dataSlice.teardown.ts`,

    // the effect that owns that channel (`useGeometryStreaming.ts`, "if
    // (pendingColorUpdates === null) return") — only a non-null EMPTY map

    // tint (or lens colouring) stayed pushed at the renderer across a model
    // switch. The helper releases it with an empty `Map`.
