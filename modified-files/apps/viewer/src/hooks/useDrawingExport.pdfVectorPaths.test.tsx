/**
 * `handleExportPDF` has two writers, and which one runs decides whether the
 * exported PDF is resolution-independent. That split is a documented
 * trade-off (see the long note on the `sheetEnabled && activeSheet` branch
 * in useDrawingExport.ts) and until now nothing pinned it:
 *
 *  - SHEET mode rasterizes `generateSheetSVG()` to a PNG and places that one
 *    image across the paper. This is what fixed #2941 (no frame, title block
 *    or scale bar) and #2942 (not to scale) — the sheet layout only exists
 *    inside `generateSheetSVG`, and jsPDF has no SVG import — at the cost of
 *    a PDF that pixelates under zoom.
 *  - NON-SHEET mode ("as displayed" / scaled, #2042) writes jsPDF vector
 *    primitives and rasterizes nothing.
 *
 * Both halves matter and each protects the other. Without the first, a
 * future "make the sheet vector again" change would quietly reintroduce
 * #2941/#2942 unless it also re-derived the whole sheet layout. Without the
 * second, routing everything through the raster helper — the obvious
 * simplification, since it already handles one case — would silently make
 * the viewer's only true-vector PDF OF THE DRAWING a bitmap, with nothing
 * to catch it: the export still succeeds, still has the right page size,
 * and still looks right at 100%. (`lib/lists/export/pdf.ts` also emits
 * pure vector, through `jspdf-autotable`, but that is a tabular report
 * rather than a drawing; `lib/export/view-pdf/` is a raster.)
 *
 * The observation is what reaches jsPDF: `addImage` (a raster was embedded)
 * versus `lines` (vector primitives were written). Both are spied on
 * `jsPDF.API`, not `jsPDF.prototype` — jsPDF copies its plugin methods onto
 * each instance as own properties at construction time, so patching the
 * prototype patches nothing a real instance calls.
 *
 * `HTMLCanvasElement`'s 2D context and `Image` decoding do not exist under
 * happy-dom, so the sheet path's browser rasterization plumbing is stubbed
 * exactly as useDrawingExport.pdfSheet.test.tsx stubs it. That stub is what
 * makes `addImage` reachable at all here; it does not decide which branch
 * runs, which is the only thing these tests assert on.
