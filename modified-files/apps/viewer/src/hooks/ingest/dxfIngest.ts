/**
 * DXF ingest path for the viewer (issue #1782).
 *
 * DXF files are 2D reference drawings, not models: they never enter the
 * model pipeline (`useIfcLoader.loadFile`) — a dropped DXF must not
 * replace or federate with the loaded IFC. Instead the file is parsed
 * with `@ifc-lite/drawing-2d`'s `importDxf` and registered as an underlay
 * consumed by the 2D drawing view. Every file entry point (drop, Open)
 * splits DXFs off first via `splitDxfFiles` and routes the rest onward.
 *
 * Issue #1929: a surveyor's DXF is usually authored in map/CRS coordinates
 * (eastings/northings), not the IFC model's local frame — the mirror image
 * of the `.laz`/`.las` point-cloud alignment issue #1804 already solved.
 *
 * PR #1965 review: `ingestDxfFile` used to resolve the anchor's
 * georeference SYNCHRONOUSLY at import time and bake the result into the
 * new underlay's `georeferenced` toggle as a plain boolean. That races the
 * REPORTER'S ACTUAL WORKFLOW: `ViewportContainer.handleDrop` splits DXFs
 * off first (`splitDxfFiles`) and fires `void ingestDxfFiles(dxfFiles)`
 * immediately, concurrently with — not after — the model files' load. Drop
 * `model.ifc` and `survey.dxf` together and this function used to run
 * before `ifcDataStore`/`models` had the new model in them, resolve no
 * georeference, and seed the toggle OFF — the DXF lands kilometres away and
 * the toast says nothing wrong. That made the documented "DXF dropped
 * before any IFC model loads" case the DEFAULT outcome for a combined
 * drop, not a rare edge.
 *
 * Fix: `ingestDxfFile` now seeds the toggle to `'auto'` (stored as
 * `undefined` — see `DxfUnderlayState.georeferenced`'s doc in
 * `drawing2DSlice.ts`), which `dxfUnderlayMath.ts`'s
 * `resolveEffectiveGeoreferenced` resolves LAZILY every render from
 * whatever the anchor's georeference currently is. A same-drop model that
 * finishes loading after the DXF still ends up aligned, with no race,
 * and an anchor removed/re-added later in the session is followed too.
 * Explicit `true`/`false` are written ONLY when the user flips the
 * checkbox (`setDxfUnderlayGeoreferenced`) — auto-seeded entries and
 * user-set entries are stored identically once explicit, but only THIS
 * function's import path ever creates an entry in auto mode; every other
 * `addDxfUnderlay` call site defaults to `false` (see that action's doc),
 * so an entry that predates this feature (or any future load/migration
 * path that doesn't explicitly request `'auto'`) can never silently start
 * following the anchor.
