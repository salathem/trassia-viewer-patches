 * Format a distance in meters to a human-readable string, honoring the

 * defaults to `{}` so every pre-#2199 call site (which never knew about
 * unit overrides) keeps its exact prior behaviour unchanged.
 *
 * This is deliberately the ONE exported distance formatter — #2199 briefly
 * shipped a second, override-aware `formatDistanceDisplay` beside this
 * unconditionally-metric one, which left every measure-tool call site free
 * to pick either name and get a plausible-looking but wrong (unconverted)
 * result. Folding the override handling in here removes that choice instead
 * of guarding it.
 *
 * `meters` is always already SI: every distance the measure tool produces —
 * drag endpoints, axis deltas, picked-point offsets — is renderer/model
 * space, which is metres throughout (geometry is unit-scaled to metres at
 * import; see `measure-modes/coordinates.ts`). Display therefore resolves
 * against an EMPTY unit context, exactly like `MeasureQuantities`' totals:
 * handing it a file's declared millimetres would scale an already-metre
 * value a second time.

 *
 * This is for a triple that IS a distance — the Measure tool's
 * relative-reference offset (dx/dy/dz from a user-set datum), the same kind
 * of signed length `formatAxisDeltas` already converts — not a raw model
 * coordinate. `formatCoordinateTriple` in `measure-modes/coordinates.ts`
 * stays in unlabelled metres for the Model / Render / Map rows, which are
 * point positions in a file's own coordinate system or a projected CRS, and
 * are deliberately out of #2199's scope.
 *
 * The `Δ` prefix and the explicit `+` are the #2737 §3 acceptance criterion —
 * *a relative coordinate is visually distinct from an absolute one* — carried
 * in the VALUE rather than only in the row label beside it. The viewer names
 * four kinds of coordinate (model-local, project/anchor, render-frame world
 * and georeferenced), every one of which prints as `X … Y … Z …`; a fifth kind
 * that printed the same way would be told apart only by the label cell, and a
 * label cell is exactly what a narrow panel, a copied line or a screenshot
 * crop loses. `ΔX +2.500` cannot be misread as a position no matter where it
 * is quoted.
 *
 * A zero axis gets no sign: an offset of nothing has no direction, and `+0.000`
 * claims one.
 *
 * Deep review on #2538: before this, the relative row converted only its
 * trailing distance hint, leaving the triple beside it in unlabelled metres —
 * a `ft` override made the row read e.g. `X 1.000 Y 2.000 Z 3.000  12.2758
 * ft`, mixing units in one line. All three axes share one override, so the
 * unit is resolved once by the caller (from the accompanying
 * {@link formatDistance} hint) rather than printed three times here.
