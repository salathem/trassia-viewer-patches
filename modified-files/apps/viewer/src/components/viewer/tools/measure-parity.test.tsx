/**
 * Both-toolbar guard for the Measure tool (#2199).
 *
 * The viewer ships two desktop toolbars at once — the classic `MainToolbar`
 * strip and the tabbed ribbon — and a user sits behind exactly one of them.
 * #2510 and #2511 close that gap for camera and export by giving each a single
 * ordered command registry plus a drift guard.
 *
 * Measure does not need a registry, and adding one would be the wrong fix: the
 * two toolbars do not host measurement UI at all. Each does one thing —
 * `setActiveTool('measure')` — and `ToolOverlays` renders the ONE panel off
 * that store field. There is no second list to drift from the first.
 *
 * What CAN drift is that structure itself, in three ways, and this file guards
 * each:
 *
 * 1. a toolbar stops dispatching `'measure'` (the ribbon-only search bug of
 *    #2510, in its measure-shaped form);
 * 2. a toolbar grows its own measurement UI beside the shared panel, which is
 *    how two hand-maintained lists get created in the first place;
 * 3. the shared panel stops hosting a section, so the section's own tests stay
 *    green while the feature ships unreachable — the exact hole #2510 and
 *    #2511 each found in their first guard.
 *
 * (3) is asserted by DRIVING `ToolOverlays`, the real host, not by rendering
 * the section components directly: a section is proven only by clicking its
 * button on the shipped panel and reading the numbers that come back.
 *
 * That same harness then earns its keep a second time. The last describe block
 * pins WHERE each printed number is allowed to come from — the instanced-only
 * volume side channel, the server-parsed quantity table, a federated model
 * whose volumes alignment invalidated, and the frame a picked point is
 * genuinely expressed in. Each of those is a place where a plausible number
 * can be printed from the wrong source, which is invisible to a test that only
 * checks a number appeared.
 *
 * (1) and (2) were asserted in SOURCE TEXT here, on the claim that neither
 * toolbar could be mounted in the node runner (`MainToolbar` drags in the whole
 * viewer; `HomeTab` reaches `@/icons`, a Vite virtual module). That claim is
 * false as of #2540's loader hooks: both mount, `ViewportContainer` mounts
 * given a WebGPU adapter and a loaded model, and `PropertiesPanel` mounts given
 * a real parsed store. So (1) is now a click on the Measure control with the
 * store read back, (2) is the absence of the panel's own controls in a mounted
 * toolbar, and the frame assertion is on the printed coordinate rather than on
 * the presence of a hook call (#2434).
 *
 * That matters beyond tidiness: the old form could not distinguish a control
 * that renders from a control that WORKS. `setActiveTool('measure')` written in
 * a handler that nothing invokes matched the regex exactly as well.
