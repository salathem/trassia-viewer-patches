/**
 * Click handler for angle mode (#2735).
 *
 * There is no finish gesture - every angle kind has a FIXED pick count and the
 * store finishes the measurement itself on the last pick - so polyline's
 * `fromDoubleClick` apparatus has no analogue here.
 *
 * But the duplicate-click DEFENCE still does, and an earlier version of this
 * comment claimed otherwise on false grounds. It argued a stray second click
 * "lands where the maths already classifies coincident picks as degenerate".
 * Only APEX-coincidence is degenerate. Browsers fire `click, click, dblclick`,
 * so a habitual double-click produces three distinct failures here:
 *
 *   1. double-clicking a DIRECTION point makes picks 2 and 3 coincide - a
 *      recorded "0.0°", rendered as a real answer rather than an em dash;
 *   2. double-clicking the THIRD pick finishes on the first click and the
 *      second click starts a stray new sequence, so "1/3 picks · apex set"
 *      appears unbidden;
 *   3. double-clicking the APEX puts picks 1 and 2 a pixel or two apart - a
 *      ray whose direction is cursor noise, and pick 3 then yields a
 *      confident, wrong `angled` number.
 *
 * So the same `isDuplicateClickPoint` guard polyline uses applies: a click
 * within {@link DUPLICATE_POINT_SCREEN_RADIUS_PX} of the previous pick is the
 * second half of one physical double-click and is dropped. Dropping is safe
 * because a genuinely intended pick that close is unmeasurable anyway.
 *
 * A miss is a no-op, matching polyline's contract.
 *
 * Only the `'points'` kind ships today; `'edges'` and `'faces'` are the later
 * slices of #2735 and will need their own pick resolution (an edge run from
 * `SnapTarget.metadata`, a camera-oriented face normal from the intersection),
 * which is why the pick carries its `kind` rather than being a bare point.
