/**
 * Wheel zoom: the step the wheel applies, and the modifier that makes it finer
 * (#2683).
 *
 * QGIS is the reference the request cited. Its map canvas divides the *excess
 * over 1* of the wheel zoom factor by 20 while Ctrl is down, under the comment
 * "holding ctrl while wheel zooming results in a finer zoom"
 * (`QgsMapCanvas::wheelEvent`, src/gui/qgsmapcanvas.cpp), and the user manual
 * says the same. So the convention is FINER, not faster, and it is a change of
 * step size, not of direction.
 *
 * We follow the intent rather than the literal divisor. QGIS' unmodified notch
 * is a 2x jump (100% of the current scale); ours is a tenth of that -- the
 * renderer clamps a notch at `MAX_ZOOM_DELTA` = 0.1, so a wheel notch moves
 * ~10% -- and dividing that by 20 would leave ~0.5% per notch, several hundred
 * notches to halve the view distance. A fifth of the default step lands at ~2%
 * per notch: finer than QGIS' fine zoom in absolute terms, still responsive
 * enough that a flick of the wheel visibly moves.
 *
 * The unmodified wheel is untouched, so existing muscle memory is unchanged.

/**
 * Tracks whether Ctrl or Cmd is PHYSICALLY held, from keyboard events.
 *
 * A wheel event's own `ctrlKey` cannot answer that question. Browsers
 * synthesise a wheel event with `ctrlKey: true` for a trackpad pinch -- macOS
 * is the familiar case, but Chromium does it for precision touchpads on
 * Windows and Linux too -- and no keyboard event accompanies it. Reading
 * `e.ctrlKey` alone would therefore hand every pinch-zoom the fine step, which
 * is exactly the gesture users expect to move the camera at full speed.
 *
 * Keyboard events do not lie: they only fire for real key presses, and every
 * one of them reports the true modifier state, so `keydown` for Ctrl (which
 * itself carries `ctrlKey: true`) opens the gate and its `keyup` closes it.
 * That is why the modifier is Ctrl *and* Cmd on every platform rather than a
 * per-platform mapping: with a real key press required, Ctrl means Ctrl on a
 * Mac as well, which is what the request asked for, and Cmd is accepted
 * alongside it because that is the modifier Mac users reach for.
 *
 * Focus can be lost with the key down (Ctrl+Tab, a Space switch), which would
 * leave the flag stuck on; `blur` resets it, and {@link isFineZoomWheel} also
 * requires the wheel event to agree, so a stale flag alone can never engage
 * the fine step. The mirror case is a key already down when the tracker is
 * created, which no keyboard event announces: the fine step then waits for the
 * next press. The viewport mounts once at startup, well before anyone reaches
 * for Ctrl, so that costs at most the very first gesture of a session.
